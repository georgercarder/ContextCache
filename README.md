## ContextCache


PERFECT for use in view functions requiring lots of intermediate caching of processed data.

To run tests just call `forge test -vv`

Usage:

Just inherit the `ContextCache` into any contract where you need this functionality, 
and follow the usage pattern outlined in the comments of the `ContractCache` contract
and the test.
